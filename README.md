# Ordinals
Welcome to the world of Ordinals. 

This project aims to represent a cardinal number as an ordinal for any language conceivable on planet Earth and beyond! However, first things first, what is an ordinal?

## What is an Ordinal?
An ordinal is a word that is used to describe the position of an entity in a series.

For example, "first" is the English word used to describe the entity that comes before any other entity in a series of entities. "second" is the word that describes the entity that comes after the "first" entity.

It's prudent to note that "first" and "second" refer to different entities. 

Different languages have different words for ordinals. The ordinal representation as used in Spanish is not the same as the one you will find used in French even though the two representations describe the same series.

## What spoken languages do we cover
As many as we can. This project aims to address ordinals for any language conceivable on planet Earth and beyond! It's also meant to be extendable, feel free to provide support for a spoken language of your choice. However, in the meantime, we are fully covering the following languages:
* English
* French
* German

Work on the following languages is in progress:
* Spanish
* Italian

Feel free to provide feedback on the accuracy of our translations. We'll appreciate that.

## How do I contribute
You can start by sending a request to join our slack workspace to one of us, our emails for your reference are as follows:
* gregmattes@gmail.com
* gssenyonjo@gmail.com

Notice we both start with g ;-)

## Can my contributions make a difference
Sure they can. Our mission is to express any number as an ordinal for all languages on planet Earth and beyond! All you need to do is to find a language we are not yet covering and express it as a set or rules using a domain specific language we invented and that should be it.

## Am I allowed to use this project in my own work?
Yes! The project uses an MIT License. You're free to use our software but be sure to give a shout out for us.

## Kindly tell me how to adopt your project in my work
The instructions on that are at the bottom of the page.

## What programming languages are covered?
We are looking into ways of porting the library to any programming language. However, as of now, the following programming languages are supported:
* Java



#How to build and test
## Ant
From the command line, 
run: `ant`

A jar file is created in folder `ordinals/dist`. Navigate to that
folder via the command line. 
run: `java -cp ordinals.jar com.github.ordinals.TestXMLParser`
The program should now run.
